## Tasks

### 1. Image Segmentation Using Thresholding 
- **Objective**: Segment a grayscale image using thresholding methods.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Apply the following methods:
    - Binary Thresholding
    - Adaptive Thresholding
    - Otsuâ€™s Thresholding (10 Marks)
  - Display the original and segmented images side by side for comparison with clear labels. (5 Marks)
  - Discuss which method provided the best segmentation and why, considering factors like object boundaries and noise. (5 Marks)

---

### 2. Line Detection Using Hough Transform 
- **Objective**: Detect and highlight straight lines in an image.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Use Canny edge detection and apply the Hough Line Transform to identify straight lines. (10 Marks)
  - Test the function on an image with distinct lines, such as roads or grid structures. Display the original and processed images. (5 Marks)
  - Experiment with threshold parameters, describe changes, and their effects on line detection. (5 Marks)

---

### 3. Circle Detection Using Hough Circle Transform
- **Objective**: Detect circular objects in an image.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Implement the Hough Circle Transform with preprocessing steps like smoothing for better accuracy. (10 Marks)
  - Apply the function to images with circular objects, displaying original and processed images. (5 Marks)
  - Experiment with radius ranges and accumulator thresholds. Explain observed improvements. (5 Marks)

---

### 4. Harris Corner Detection 
- **Objective**: Detect and mark corners in an image.
- **Subtasks**:
  - Create a function using the Harris Corner Detection method and overlay detected corners on the original image. (10 Marks)
  - Test on images with distinct corners, such as chessboards or buildings, and display results. (5 Marks)
  - Vary the sensitivity parameter `k`, observe effects, and explain findings. (5 Marks)

---

### 5. Short Theory 
- **Task**: Explain differences between the Hough Transform for line and circle detection in 100-150 words.
- **Considerations**:
  - Parameter space representation.
  - Computational complexity variations.
